You are an expert Full-Stack engineer working on this existing project (React + Vite frontend, Express + TypeScript backend).

GOAL:
Update the contact details **everywhere in the codebase** so that:
- Phone number / WhatsApp number → 8700762477
- Email address → ranjanmanish615@gmail.com

This must be done consistently across frontend UI, backend responses, static content, configs, and metadata.

--- EXACT REQUIREMENTS ---

1) PHONE / WHATSAPP UPDATE
Replace **all occurrences** of old phone numbers (including but not limited to):
- +91 8178875502
- +91 9999393355
- Any other phone variants (with/without +91, spaces, hyphens)

WITH:
- Display format (UI): +91 8700762477
- Raw format (links, APIs): 8700762477

Places to update:
- Header / Top bar
- Footer
- Call Now buttons
- WhatsApp floating button
- Contact sections
- Hero CTA text
- Service booking forms
- Static text blocks (marketing content, descriptions)
- Any hardcoded constants or config files
- Any backend response that returns contact info
- Meta tags (if phone appears)
- README or docs (if phone appears)

Ensure:
- `tel:` links → `tel:+918700762477`
- WhatsApp links → `https://wa.me/918700762477`

2) EMAIL UPDATE
Replace **all occurrences** of any old email address with:
- ranjanmanish615@gmail.com

Places to update:
- Contact sections
- Footer
- Forms (default email, admin email, support email)
- Backend configs/constants
- README / documentation
- Meta tags (if email exists)
- Any API payloads or response examples

3) CODE QUALITY RULES
- Do NOT miss any file (search entire repo).
- Preserve formatting and styling.
- Do not introduce hard-coded duplicates—if a central config exists, refactor to reuse it.
- If no central config exists, create one:
  - `client/src/lib/contact.ts` (export phone, whatsapp, email)
  - `server/config/contact.ts` (same values for backend use)
  And replace all hardcoded usage with imports.

4) VERIFICATION STEPS (MANDATORY)
After changes:
- Run `npm run dev`
- Confirm in browser:
  - Header shows updated phone
  - Call Now works
  - WhatsApp button opens correct chat
  - Footer and contact sections show new email & phone
- Confirm no old phone/email remains via project-wide search.

5) COMMIT
Commit message (exact):
`chore(contact): update phone number and email across entire project`

Push the changes to the current branch.

6) FINAL RESPONSE FORMAT
In your final message, include:
- List of files modified
- Confirmation that no old phone/email remains
- Screenshot-equivalent textual confirmation (e.g. header/footer strings)
- Git commit hash

Do NOT ask follow-up questions. Make safe assumptions and complete the task fully.
