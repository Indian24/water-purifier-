You are an expert full-stack engineer working inside my Replit repo (React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind). I need you to **create/update frontend components** that render the three tables shown in the screenshots and the text I pasted (AMC plans, Spare Parts Price List, Domestic & Commercial Service Charges). Put the data exactly as provided and make the components responsive, accessible, and styled with Tailwind to match the orange header / bordered table look in the screenshots.

Do everything automatically: create files, update the Home page (or a single page component) to import and render them, run a local build check, and commit the changes to git. Use only TypeScript React functional components.

**FILES TO CREATE / UPDATE**
1. `client/src/components/AMCPlans.tsx` — renders the AMC plans table
2. `client/src/components/SparePartsTable.tsx` — renders the spare parts price list
3. `client/src/components/ServiceCharges.tsx` — renders the domestic and commercial service charges (two tables, with headings)
4. `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` (or `client/src/App.tsx` / `client/src/main.tsx` depending on repo) — import and render the 3 components in logical order (AMC → Spare Parts → Service Charges)
5. Ensure `client/src/components/index.ts` exports the new components (if existing pattern). If the project uses a different page file, update that file instead — ensure the content appears on the main public route.

**UI / ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS**
- Use semantic `<table>`, `<caption>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th scope="col">`, `<th scope="row">`.
- Add `aria-label` or `caption` for screen readers.
- Mobile-first responsive: tables should scroll horizontally on small screens (wrap in `<div className="overflow-x-auto">`).
- Styling (Tailwind): orange header row `bg-orange-600 text-white font-semibold`, borders `border`, row padding `py-3 px-4`, centered numeric columns for prices.
- Keep markup clean and reusable: separate a small `Table` wrapper if helpful.

**DATA TO RENDER (use exactly these rows/labels/price values)**

1) AMC Plans — table columns: PARTICULARS | PLAN 1 | PLAN 2 | PLAN 3  
Rows:
- PRICE → ₹1750 | ₹2550 | ₹3660
- SERVICE → Yes | Yes | Yes
- FILTERS → No | Yes | Yes
- MEMBRANE → No | No | Yes
- ELECTRICAL PARTS → No | Yes | Yes
- FAULTY PARTS → No | Yes | Yes

2) Spare Parts Price List — columns: SERIAL NO. | RO PARTS NAME | PRICE (RS.)
Rows:
1. Carbon Filter — ₹450  
2. Sediment Filter — ₹450  
3. Membrane — ₹1250/ 1650  
4. Spun Filter — ₹150/ 250  
5. Adapter — ₹750  
6. Solenoid Valve (SV) — ₹450  
7. RO Pumps — ₹1650/1850  
8. Flow Resistor (FR) — ₹100  
9. Tape — ₹100  
10. UA Lamp — ₹350  
11. UV Adapter — ₹350  
12. Carbon, Sediment and Spun Filters — ₹1050  
13. Carbon, Sediment, Membrane and Spun Filters — ₹2250

3) Domestic & Commercial Service Charges — two labeled sections:

**Domestic RO Service Charges in Delhi** (columns: SERVICE TYPE | CHARGES)
Rows:
- RO REPAIR → ₹150 + Spare Parts Cost
- RO SERVICE → ₹150 + Spare Parts Cost
- RO INSTALLATION → ₹400 + Spare Parts Cost
- RO UN-INSTALLATION → ₹200
- RO INSTALLATION & RO UN-INSTALLATION → ₹500 + Spare Parts Cost

**Commercial RO Service Charges in Delhi** (columns: SERVICE TYPE | CHARGES)
Rows:
- RO MACHINE UPTO 50 LPH REPAIR & SERVICE → ₹199
- RO MACHINE UPTO 100 LPH TO 250 LPH REPAIR & SERVICE → ₹249
- RO MACHINE UPTO 500 LPH TO 1000 LPH REPAIR & SERVICE → ₹499
- RO MACHINE 1000 LPH AND ABOVE REPAIR & SERVICE → ₹1499

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**
- Each component must export `export default function AMCPlans(){...}` (and similarly for others) using TypeScript (`.tsx`).
- Do not fetch from backend — render static data in the components for now (hardcoded arrays in the component file or imported JSON).
- Add a short caption above each table (H3/H2) matching the screenshots (e.g., “Our RO AMC Plans”, “RO Spare Part Price List”, “Domestic RO Service Charges in Delhi”, “Commercial RO Service Charges in Delhi”).
- Add `data-testid` attributes for main elements (table wrapper) to help automated testing.
- Ensure tables look visually close to screenshots: orange header, thin borders, centered headings.

**BUILD & QA**
- After creating files, run `npm run dev` (or `npm run build` then `npm run dev`) and confirm the dev server starts without TypeScript or runtime errors.
- Open the main page and verify the three components render and are responsive.
- Provide short console output showing `vite` dev server started (or `npm run dev` succeeded).

**GIT**
- Commit changes with the message: `feat(ui): add AMC, SpareParts and ServiceCharges tables`
- Push to the current branch.

**If any file path in this prompt doesn't exactly match your repo layout, detect the correct place for frontend pages (for example `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`, `client/src/App.tsx`, or `client/src/main.tsx`) and update that file to render these components. Always prefer the existing routing/page entrypoint.**

---

**Deliverable:** edit/add the files described, ensure components render with the exact table data above, run a dev build check, commit and push. After finishing, print a short summary of changed files and the command output that shows the app is running and the components are visible.
