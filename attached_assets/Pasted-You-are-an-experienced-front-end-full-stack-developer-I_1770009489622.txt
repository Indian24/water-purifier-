You are an experienced front-end/full-stack developer. I will provide several background images (hero, section, pattern). Using those images, update the website to make it more attractive by adding tasteful *responsive background images* across the layout (hero, feature sections, footer) and a subtle decorative pattern. Do everything in TypeScript + React + Tailwind (project already uses Tailwind). Work autonomously and commit changes. Do not ask clarifying questions — assume the images will be uploaded to the repo at `assets/raw/` as files I provide.

GOAL
- Add the images I give as responsive, optimized background art in the hero area, a major content section, and as a subtle decorative pattern (e.g., footer or cards).
- Optimize images (webp, multiple sizes), lazy-load them, keep good contrast/legibility, and add a gradient overlay for readability.
- Provide progressive enhancement (blur-up placeholder → high-res) and small parallax / motion on desktop only (no heavy animations on mobile).
- Produce a clean commit with changed/added files and a short verification checklist.

STEPS (do in order)

1) ASSETS: create these folders and move the provided images:
   - `assets/raw/` — place the original images I upload here (do not commit huge originals if > 10MB; compress if necessary).
   - `assets/img/` — generated/optimized images (webp + jpeg fallbacks).
   - `assets/img/placeholder/` — tiny blurred base64 placeholders (optional).

2) IMAGE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Install small tooling if needed: `npm i -D sharp` (or `imagemin-cli` if preferred).
   - Add a Node script `scripts/optimize-images.js` that:
     - Reads images from `assets/raw/`
     - Produces multiple widths: 400, 800, 1200, 1920 (webp and jpeg fallback)
     - Produces a tiny blurred placeholder (20–50px) and write placeholder as `placeholder-<name>.txt` containing base64 data URI
     - Save outputs to `assets/img/<name>-{w}.webp` and `assets/img/<name>-{w}.jpg`
   - Add `npm run optimize-images` script to package.json.

3) LAYOUT CHANGES — components & structure
   - Create a small image-background utility component:
     - `client/src/components/Background/ResponsiveBg.tsx`
       - Props: `name` (base name from assets), `className`, `overlay` (optional), `parallax` (boolean)
       - Renders a `<div>` with CSS `background-image` via `style` or tailwind `style` binding, uses `picture` fallback if needed or `data-` attributes + IntersectionObserver to lazy-load the high-res background.
       - Uses `srcset` style logic: choose the best optimized file from `assets/img/` for current viewport width.
       - Adds an accessible `aria-hidden="true"` and optional overlay `<div aria-hidden="true">` with gradient.
   - Update hero component (`client/src/components/Hero.tsx` or `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`) to:
     - Use the hero image `name` (e.g., `hero-01`) via `ResponsiveBg`.
     - Add a 40–60% dark/blue gradient overlay (Tailwind: `bg-gradient-to-b from-black/20 to-white/0` or inline RGBA) to ensure text remains readable.
     - Use `background-position: center` and `background-size: cover`.
     - Add a subtle `transform` animation on scroll for parallax (desktop only — `@media (min-width: 768px)`), or use `data-parallax` and small JS to translate `Y` at 0.1× scroll speed.
   - Add a decorative pattern file (SVG or subtle texture) for footer or cards:
     - Place pattern as `assets/img/pattern.svg` and use `background-repeat: repeat` with low opacity overlay to avoid distraction.
   - Add background to a major feature section (e.g., “Our Services”) using a different, softer image than hero. Use a light overlay so dark text stands out.

4) PERFORMANCE & RESPONSIVENESS
   - Lazy-load background images using IntersectionObserver:
     - Load a tiny blurred placeholder inline as background first (base64 from `assets/img/placeholder/`).
     - When element is in viewport, swap to appropriate `url()` using `srcset` logic or set CSS variable to chosen high-res file.
   - Add `loading="lazy"` behavior for any `<img>` fallback used for decorative images.
   - Use `webp` files by default and `jpg` fallback for older browsers (use <picture> if using `<img>`, or use `image-set()` if using CSS `background-image`).
   - Ensure total added bytes are reasonable: prefer webp and compress at quality 75-80.

5) ACCESSIBILITY & UX
   - Ensure text contrast meets WCAG (overlay + text color).
   - Decorative images must be `aria-hidden="true"` and not interfere with screen readers.
   - Ensure click targets visible and not on top of decorative parts that reduce contrast.
   - Provide CSS media queries so that on small screens the background becomes a solid color or a very subtle texture instead of large images (to reduce mobile data).

6) FALLBACKS & STYLING
   - For mobile or slower connections, provide a CSS fallback class `bg-fallback-color` (use brand color palette).
   - Avoid `background-attachment: fixed` (it’s problematic on mobile). Use transform-based parallax for desktop only.

7) TAILWIND INTEGRATION
   - If project uses Tailwind, add helper classes or inline Tailwind classes, e.g.:
     - Hero wrapper: `relative overflow-hidden bg-center bg-cover`
     - Overlay: `absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-black/30 to-transparent`
     - Content: `relative z-10 max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6`
   - Add a small utility in `tailwind.config.ts` if custom gradient or plugin is needed.

8) FILES TO CREATE / MODIFY (exact suggestions)
   - `assets/raw/` — put provided originals here
   - `assets/img/` — generated optimized images
   - `scripts/optimize-images.js` — image build script
   - `client/src/components/Background/ResponsiveBg.tsx` — new
   - `client/src/components/Hero.tsx` — update to use ResponsiveBg (or modify existing hero)
   - `client/src/components/Footer.tsx` — add subtle pattern background
   - `client/src/styles/bg-utils.css` (or Tailwind classes) — small CSS for overlays/parallax
   - `package.json` — add `optimize-images` script
   - optionally add tests or instructions to README about the image optimization step

9) VERIFICATION STEPS (MANDATORY)
   - Run `npm run optimize-images` and commit outputs to `assets/img/` (small sizes only); do NOT commit huge original raw files (>10MB) — if raw files are huge, compress or add `.gitignore` for raw and keep them outside repo.
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - In the browser check:
     - Hero shows new background and text is readable
     - Major section shows its background with overlay and text readable
     - Footer shows decorative pattern (low-contrast)
     - On mobile, backgrounds degrade to a solid color or subtle pattern
     - Network tab shows `webp` images and lazy-loading (images load when entering viewport)
   - Run an audit in Chrome DevTools (Lighthouse) and ensure performance and accessibility don't significantly regress.

10) COMMIT / PUSH
   - Commit message (exact): `feat(ui): add responsive background images + optimization script`
   - In final reply include:
     - List of files created/modified
     - The `npm` commands run (and their output summary)
     - A short note confirming performance & accessibility checks and any tradeoffs you made (e.g., mobile uses pattern instead of hero image)

DELIVERABLES (what I expect in your final response)
- A list of changed/created files with short purpose for each.
- The `git commit` hash and the commit message.
- A one-paragraph summary describing the look & behavior you implemented (hero treatment, overlay, parallax behaviour, mobile fallback).
- Verification checklist (what to open in browser + network checks).
- If anything cannot be done automatically (e.g., extremely large raw assets >50MB), explain the manual step I must do.

NOTES / ASSUMPTIONS
- You will be given the images and you will place them under `assets/raw/`. If any file is > 15MB, compress before committing; if uncompressible, don’t commit the original — commit optimized outputs only.
- Keep changes minimal and non-destructive to existing layout — integrate seamlessly with current Tailwind system.
- Use `webp` where possible, `jpeg` fallback only if necessary.

End. Make the changes and reply with the final list of files and the git commit hash.
