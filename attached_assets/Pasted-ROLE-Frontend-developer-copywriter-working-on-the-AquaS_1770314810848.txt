ROLE: Frontend developer / copywriter working on the AquaShield React site (client side only).

OBJECTIVE: Replace the hero / tagline and supporting copy on the Home page so the wording is simple, clear, non-plagiarized, and customer-friendly. Add a single short line that communicates a price-match guarantee. Do **not** touch server/backend code. Keep the existing CTA buttons ("Call Now" and "Book RO Repair Service") and their visuals untouched.

TASKS (exact):
1. Locate the hero text to replace. Typical file locations:
   - client/src/pages/Home.tsx
   - client/src/components/Hero.tsx
   - client/src/components/HeaderHero.tsx
   - Or search the `client` folder for the phrase: `No Matter Whichever Your RO Brand` or `We Repair All` (case-insensitive).

2. Replace the hero headline with the primary copy below (pick one variant; implement Variant A as default):

   VARIANT A (recommended, plain & clear)
   - Headline (short):  
     **Fast, Reliable RO Repair & Installation in Delhi NCR**
   - Subheadline (1–2 lines):  
     **Doorstep repair, installation, and AMC — hygiene-first technicians, same-day service (often within 1 hour).**
   - Micro line (new price promise, shown under the subheadline or as a badge):  
     **Price Match Guarantee — find a lower price online or offline and we'll match or beat it.**
   - Meta description (for page head / SEO):  
     `Get fast RO repair, installation & AMC across Delhi NCR. Trusted technicians, genuine parts, and a price-match guarantee. Call +91 8700762477.`

   VARIANT B (shorter / more emotional)
   - Headline:  
     **Delhi’s Trusted RO Service — Fast, Clean, Reliable**
   - Subheadline:  
     **Doorstep RO repairs, installations and AMC. Hygiene-first technicians and same-day fixes.**
   - Micro line (price promise):  
     **We match or beat any price — online or in-store.**

   VARIANT C (brand-forward)
   - Headline:  
     **AquaShield — Fast RO Repair & Installation for Delhi NCR**
   - Subheadline:  
     **Same-day doorstep service, verified technicians, and a price-match guarantee for total peace of mind.**

3. Placement & style guidance:
   - Keep CTA buttons exactly as-is: "Call Now" and "Book RO Repair Service".
   - Place the **Price Match Guarantee** as a single small line under the subheadline or as a small highlighted pill/badge near CTAs. Use consistent typography and a subtle accent color (use your site’s blue/orange palette).
   - Add accessible attributes:
     - Headline should be an H1 on the home page.
     - Subheadline should be H2/H3 depending on current structure.
     - Add `aria-label` to the hero section: `aria-label="AquaShield hero — fast RO repair and installation in Delhi NCR"`.

4. SEO & OG:
   - Update `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` in the Home page (client-side rendering). Use the meta description provided above.
   - Add OG tags in the home page head if present (og:title = headline, og:description = meta description, og:image = hero image).

5. Copy editing rules:
   - Keep language plain English, avoid marketing superlatives that cannot be supported by evidence (e.g., "best" is OK only if you have proof; prefer "trusted" or "fast, reliable").
   - Keep hero headline ≤ 70 characters for SEO and social sharing.
   - Subheadline ≤ 160 characters for readability.

6. QA & test:
   - After change, run `npm run dev` in `client` and open the home page. Confirm:
     - New headline and subheadline appear.
     - Price Match Guarantee line is visible under subheadline or in a badge near CTAs.
     - CTA buttons visually unchanged and functional.
     - Mobile/responsive: hero text does not overflow; images scale; CTAs remain visible above the fold on mobile.
   - Accessibility: confirm hero H1 exists and `aria-label` is present.

7. Commit message:
   `git add -A && git commit -m "chore(copy): update home hero copy + price-match guarantee"`

OPTIONAL: Quick PowerShell search & replace (run from repo root). **Use with caution** — preview changes first.

A) Preview files that contain the old tagline:
