ROLE: Frontend React developer.

TASK: Create and update the **Blog page UI only** for the AquaShield website.  
⚠️ This task is **frontend only**. Do NOT touch backend, database, APIs, or authentication.

GOAL:
Replace the current “Blog Coming Soon” page with a real, professional blog UI that:
1. Shows company-written blog content
2. Allows users to submit blogs/reviews via a form (UI only, no backend wiring yet)
3. Looks clean, responsive, and SEO-friendly

================================
PAGES TO CREATE / UPDATE
================================

1️⃣ Blog Listing Page  
Route: `/blog`

UI requirements:
- Page heading: **AquaShield Blog**
- Subheading text (exact copy to use):
  “Service updates, water purifier tips, and customer stories from AquaShield — serving Delhi NCR since 2006.”

- Static blog cards (for now, frontend-only mock data):
  Each card should show:
  - Blog title
  - Short excerpt
  - Date
  - Location tag (e.g. South Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida)
  - “Read More” button

Sample static blog titles to show:
- “Serving Delhi Since 2006 — 100,000+ Happy Customers”
- “RO Repair Services Across South Delhi: Our Experience”
- “Domestic & Industrial RO Service in Gurgaon and Noida”

Layout:
- Desktop: 3-column grid
- Mobile: 1-column stacked layout
- Clean cards with rounded corners and soft shadows

================================

2️⃣ Blog Detail Page  
Route: `/blog/:slug`

UI requirements:
- Large blog title
- Meta info line:
  “Posted by AquaShield | Serving Delhi NCR since 2006”
- Hero/background image section (image will be provided later)
- Long-form content section (paragraph-friendly typography)
- Highlighted section inside content mentioning:
  - 100,000+ customers served
  - Major service areas:
    South Delhi (Chhatarpur, Saket, Malviya Nagar, Vasant Vihar, Hauz Khas, Green Park, RK Puram, Vasant Kunj),
    Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad

- Bottom CTA box:
  “Need RO service in your area? Call or WhatsApp us at +91 8700762477”

================================

3️⃣ Submit Blog / Review Section (UI only)
Place this at the bottom of Blog Detail page OR as a separate section on `/blog`.

Form fields:
- Name (optional)
- Phone (optional)
- Title
- Message / Review / Blog content
- Checkbox:
  “Submit anonymously”

Submit button text:
- **Submit for Review**

On submit:
- Do NOT connect to backend
- Just show a success message UI:
  “Thank you! Your submission has been received and will be reviewed before publishing.”

================================

DESIGN & UX RULES
================================
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)
- Clean typography (easy reading)
- Soft professional colors matching AquaShield theme
- Use placeholders for images (background image support ready)
- SEO-friendly headings (H1, H2, readable paragraphs)

================================
FILES TO TOUCH (frontend only)
================================
- `client/src/pages/Blog.tsx` (listing page)
- `client/src/pages/BlogDetail.tsx`
- `client/src/components/BlogCard.tsx`
- `client/src/components/BlogSubmitForm.tsx`
- Update routing in `App.tsx` if needed

================================
DO NOT DO
================================
- ❌ No backend API calls
- ❌ No database logic
- ❌ No authentication
- ❌ No admin logic
- ❌ No real submission handling

================================
FINAL EXPECTATION
================================
After implementation:
- `/blog` shows a professional blog list
- `/blog/sample-post` opens a detailed blog page
- Users can see a submission form UI
- Everything works visually and responsively

Implement this as a clean, production-ready **frontend-only blog system**.

END.
